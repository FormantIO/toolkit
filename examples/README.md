#### Views/Moules

- Examples of what can be built that can be embeded on Formant or individually hosted.

### [Represent altitude and orientation on a map](https://github.com/FormantIO/toolkit/tree/master/examples/altitude-on-map) (React)

The Formant agent is able to collect data points that represent the altitude and orientation of a device. This data is collected from the 'Location' stream.

![App Screenshot](https://github.com/FormantIO/toolkit/tree/master/examples/altitude-on-map/blob/main/src/images/orientation.png)
The altitude is measured in Meters (m), the orientation is measured in Radians (rotation). To use orientation in the map it is necessary to convert Radian to Degrees.
