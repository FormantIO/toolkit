Outline for the ROS launch adapter


The ros launch adapter will be split into a number of parts. 

There will be an internal "roslaunch engine" which will power the adapter. 
This engine will keep track which ros launches are running, which ros launches can be shut down,
etc. There will be a standard interface which can be interacted with for the user.

This roslaunch engine will then be hooked up to the "front-end" which will consist of a way for Formant to interact with 
the ros launch engine. Once the engine is built it will be easily extendable for the front end.
