# Style components

Example of components using Formant's CDN, providing the ability to focus on developing while we will handle the design.
You can easily set the default styling of your HTML to something Formant-y with a single line:

```javascript
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/formantio/toolkit/css/formant.css"
/>
```
