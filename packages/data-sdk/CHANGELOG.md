## [1.5.3] - 2023-06-30

### Fixed

- DataChannel check ready fix (#112)

## [1.5.2] - 2023-06-29

### Fixed

- Resolve leaky reference to `NodeJS.Timeout`.

## [1.5.1] - 2023-06-29

### Fixed

- Resolve dependency cycles. (#111)

## [1.5.0] - 2023-06-28

### Changed

- Rework data-sdk bundle/package (#92)
  - packages `cjs`/`es` for package.json/bundlers _exclude_ all of their dependencies.
  - pre-bundled assets `umd`/`es6` bundles all required dependencies for stand-alone use.

### Update Notes

The dependency tree has changed slightly to support better performance/security updates moving forward. As such the 
`@formant/realtime-sdk` dependency has been changed from a `"dependency"` to a `"peerDependency"`. You will need to add
this dependency as well:

```sh
$ npm install --save @formant/realtime-sdk@latest

# or with

$ yarn add @formant/realtime-sdk@latest
```

## [1.1.0] - 2023-06-15

_Releasedâ€¦_

## [1.1.0-rc.0] - 2023-06-15

### Added

## [1.0.0] - 2023-06-05

### Fixed
- Possible to removeListener too early when waiting for `request_date` to respond. (#93)

## [1.0.0-rc.3] - 2023-05-25

`Device.startRealtimeConnection()` now accepts an optional `options` argument, to more fine-grained control over
the connection handshake behavior.

```ts
const device = Fleet.getCurrentDevice();
await device.startRealtimeConnection({
  sessionType: SessionType.Observe,
  // wait an entire minute for a connection to establish.
  deadlineMs: 60_000,
});
```

The default value for `deadlineMs` is `10000`, or 10 seconds. If `device.startRealtimeConnection()` is unsuccessful
in establishing a connection within the deadline, it will throw an error.

```ts
try {
  await device.startRealtimeConnection({
    sessionType: SessionType.Observe,
  });
} catch (err) {
  console.error("Unable to estbalish connection!");
  return;
}
```

If you would like to wait _forever_ for the connection, you can use:

```ts
await device.startRealtimeConnection({
  sessionType: SessionType.Observe,
  deadlineMs: Infinity,
});
```

### Added
- Improvements to `Device.startRealtimeConnection()` implementation (#91)

### Changed
- Pool `RtcClients` by `sessionType` to reduce network overhead for multiple conections (#89)

## [1.0.0-rc.2] - 2023-05-18

### Fixed
- Increase number of tries to create a connection (#88)
- Re-enforce type constraints on aggregateByDateFunctions (#85)

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2023-05-17

### Added
- Adding WAN connectivity helpers (#83)
  - `App.isOnline` returns the last-known connectivity status to formant apis.
  - `App.checkConnection(ms?: number)` returns a promise for the _current_ connectivity status to formant apis.
  - `App.waitForConnection(ms?: number)` returns a promise that will resolve when `App.isOnline` is `true`.

### Fixed
- Prefer cached remoteDevicePeerId when set.  (#81)
- Adding logging to RealtimeVideo and RealtimeDataStream methods (#82)
- Try to reconnect when rtc.connect returns undefined (#78)
