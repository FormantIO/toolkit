this dependency as well:

```sh
$ npm install --save @formant/realtime-sdk@latest

# or with

$ yarn add @formant/realtime-sdk@latest
```

### Fixed

- Possible to removeListener too early when waiting for `request_date` to respond. (#93)

## [1.0.0-rc.3] - 2023-05-25

`Device.startRealtimeConnection()` now accepts an optional `options` argument, to more fine-grained control over
the connection handshake behavior.

```ts
const device = Fleet.getCurrentDevice();
await device.startRealtimeConnection({
  sessionType: SessionType.Observe,
  // wait an entire minute for a connection to establish.
  deadlineMs: 60_000,
});
```

The default value for `deadlineMs` is `10000`, or 10 seconds. If `device.startRealtimeConnection()` is unsuccessful
in establishing a connection within the deadline, it will throw an error.

```ts
try {
  await device.startRealtimeConnection({
    sessionType: SessionType.Observe,
  });
} catch (err) {
  console.error("Unable to estbalish connection!");
  return;
}
```

If you would like to wait _forever_ for the connection, you can use:

```ts
await device.startRealtimeConnection({
  sessionType: SessionType.Observe,
  deadlineMs: Infinity,
});
```

### Added

- Improvements to `Device.startRealtimeConnection()` implementation (#91)

### Fixed

- Re-enforce type constraints on aggregateByDateFunctions (#85)

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2023-05-17

### Added

- Adding WAN connectivity helpers (#83)
  - `App.isOnline` returns the last-known connectivity status to formant apis.
  - `App.checkConnection(ms?: number)` returns a promise for the _current_ connectivity status to formant apis.
  - `App.waitForConnection(ms?: number)` returns a promise that will resolve when `App.isOnline` is `true`.

### Fixed

- Prefer cached remoteDevicePeerId when set. (#81)
- Adding logging to RealtimeVideo and RealtimeDataStream methods (#82)
- Try to reconnect when rtc.connect returns undefined (#78)
- Update function to use remotePeerId (#80)
