# UI SDK

A library of UI components from Formant

# Developing on UI Sdk

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

# Running storybook

```
yarn storybook
```

# Building for production

Weirdly, typescript requires npm layout package in order to generate its types

```
make
```

should run all that's necessary for creating a build
